Jupyter notebook search engine

During my machine learning studies, I used jupyter notebooks quite a bit and over time,large quantities of notebooks began to accumulate.
As the number of notebooks increased, I began to realize that it is an impossible manual task to locate study material from notebooks.
Therefor i decided to write this script.

* the script is intended to run from notebook.

* you will have to change the path to your root ipynb files (line 7):

  root_directory = 'Path to your *.ipynb files'
  
* install ipywidgets (pip install ipywidgets)
